# cifar-resnet-95
This code is a code that achieves a ~95% accuracy on the Cifar-10 dataset using Resnet-18. \
Keep in mind, there's still room for a lot of improvement, and a different model architecture will give different results.\
This is mainly a sample of how to optimize trianing for a model, and I wrote this as a way for me to learn different combinations of training methods.

### Reference to the Cifar-10 dataset
